## I. Python ramp up

1. Console play.
   
   Python is an _interpreted_ language. This means that it is read and executed line-by-line by the interpreter. More on the interpreter later. This enables Python to have an _interactive console_, where you can type a single-line expression at the console prompt and have it evaluated upon hitting **Enter/Return**.
   
   In PyCharm, click on the **Python Console** in the bottom bar to open a console.
   
   Write the following types of expressions on the console. When you are done, select all the contents of the Python console and overwrite the contents of the `console.log` file in the repository.
   
   a. Numbers, integers or reals. They evaluate to themselves.
   
   b. Strings, that is, text in _single quotes_ or _double quotes_ (e.g. 'computer' or "computer"). They evaluate to themselves.
   
   c. Assignments (e.g. `a = 6` or `string = 'engineering'`). They evaluate to the value of the right-hand side, but have the side effect that they _declare_ a variable with the name on the left-hand side. In PyCharm, you will see the declared variables in the window on the right.
